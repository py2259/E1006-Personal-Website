    <h2>A Snippet of My Work</h2>
    <p style="color:blue;">Under the guidance of a real estate broker, I've tracked five speculative townhouse redevelopment projects to demonstrate the risks of overpricing. This is one example of the properties. <b> Closed sales prices (or last asking prices) averaged 32.74% below ask which is a combined $24M discount. </b> </p>
